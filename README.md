# Ansible AMI Builder

Ansible AMI Builder is a tool used for creating AMIs on AWS for any purpose. AAB spawns AWS instances from a base AMI and registers that instance with route53, configures the instance as needed, then generates an AMI from that instance to be used for other tasks.

## To start using Ansible AMI Builder

See our documentation [here](docs/getting-started.md).
